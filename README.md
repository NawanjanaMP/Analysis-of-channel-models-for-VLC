# Analysis-of-channel-models-for-VLC
Here there are two sections One is related to the hardware side which includes the all three types that we have used to implemented.
FPGA Board(CORA Z7), Pic16f877a microcontroller and Arduino have used to functioning in three ways.

The other section is the web application which is used to plot graphs for given data by user and do some predictions.
